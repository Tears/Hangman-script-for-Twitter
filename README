Welcome to the project page of the Hangman for Twitter script. With this script,
you can play Hangman on Twitter. 

== INSTALLATION ==

Download the two files listed above and download the Abraham Twitter Library.
You also need to register your Twitter Hangman application. This can be done
at dev.twitter.com. After you registered your appliaction at Twitter and 
downloaded the library files, you have to edit beheer_dms.php and
beheer_mentions.php. At the top of these files, there are four empty variables.
Set the variables to the data from your Twitter application and edit line
19 to set the MySQL connection.

After you did this, you have to create a table. To do this, execute the following
SQL code: 

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `tmp_beheer` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `type` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `date` varchar(30) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) ENGINE=MyISAM  DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 AUTO_INCREMENT=15 ;

Congratulations! Your Hangman host is now ready to use!
